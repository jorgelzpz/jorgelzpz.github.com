Hi! I'm Jorge. I am a father of two and I live in Spain.

I love finding and maintaining simple solutions for problems, especially when it comes to technology. I enjoy using fountain pens, fixing stuff at home and cooking.

I have been using several _*nix_ flavors systems for a long time. Nowadays I consider myself an [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) enthusiast, and I quite enjoy using it in my spare time. I have grown using Linux and it is what I mainly use in my job.

I am [@jorgelzpz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@jorgelzpz) on Mastodon.
