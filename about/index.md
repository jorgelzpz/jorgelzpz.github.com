Hi! I'm Jorge López Pérez. I live in Spain.

Infrastructure management, operating systems and programming are both my profession and part of my hobbies.

I have been using several *nix flavors systems for a long time. Nowadays I consider myself an [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) enthusiast, and I quite enjoy using it in my spare time. I have grown using Linux and it is what I mainly use in my job.

I am [@jorgelzpz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@jorgelzpz) on Mastodon.
